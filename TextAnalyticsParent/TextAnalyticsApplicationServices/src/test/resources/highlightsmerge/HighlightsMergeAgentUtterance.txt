I am including the \n           letter I wrote to the CEO, and that was the response I received back for my efforts, 'I apologize, but nothing we can do'. So I am including the\n           letter here, and on every other social media platform I frequent, every blog, communication I perform with friends, co-workers, peers, and the many connections\n           I have established in my over 30 years of management in customer relation businesses.:To: Randall StephensonFrom: JamesRe: Service/ComplaintMr. \n           Stephenson,I will honestly say I am typing this and trying to remain calm as I do so. I have become so frustrated with your customer service team, the run around,\n           poor service at one of the store locations, either the deliberate misdirection or poor training with the selling specialists, I felt compelled to take the time and write\n           this letter of complaint. I hope after reading, you can come up with a solution that satisfies your business sense of customer service, as well as, my sense of the capability\n           of your company to provide that customer service.To start, I had a company provided cell phone (Samsung Galaxy S4 Active), which used the AT&T service here in Alaska\n           and was impressed with the coverage and service your company provided. In November, my company xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx communicated to all managers within the organization,\n           that they would be transitioning to a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) program. Being impressed with the coverage your company provided up here, I went to your Wasilla,\n           Alaska store to check my options. I say impressed due to the fact, that we have tried several providers up here for our delivery trucks, transportation drivers, etc,\n           and all were found lacking for coverage or customer service until I had the company try AT&T for our service provider. Since the switch, we have had no issues with \n           connectivity or service. So, I arrive at the Wasilla, Alaska location, wait patiently for about 45 minutes to get someone to help me (they were busy, around December\n           16th, so holiday shopping, and quite understandable), and when the young lady called my name, explained I had to transition to a cell phone for my company. I showed her  \n           the Samsung Galaxy I had and explained that due to the email, texting, internet, etc. I would need to perform my managerial duties, I wanted a smartphone as a replacement. \n           I explained that I loved the android platform and found it very easy to use and inquired into the choices I had for the same type of operating system with AT&Ts \n           Go Phone Program. Being a company phone, I explained I did not want to enter into a contract for the phone, but the Go Phone program seemed perfect for my needs and even\n           though the re-imbursement from my company would not cover all the costs, still felt it was worth the extra expense compared with some other options here in Alaska since \n           I was impressed with the coverage. My answer: Android platform phones were only provided with 'contracts‚Äù and that the Go Phone program offered"],

He then told us we could pick the phones up at the store or have them shipped. I decided to go to the store and pick them up. Now my family lives in crofton, so we had to decided between the bowie and the annapolis store. We decided Annapolis, and thank baby Jesus we did. The lady who checked us in was sweet and very professional (i forget her name) she was an African American lady. She got Sydnie to help us. Sydnie was nothing shy than amazing, and a breath of fresh air. She set up four phones in under two hours. Two of the phones had to be set up and ready to go (My parents phones, and they cant be bothered with doing it themselves). I wanted her to leave my phone alone as i wanted to set it up myself (I should have let her do it, its taken me far to long) all three were Iphone 6. My sisters phone was a samsung galaxy (she had that one ready to in a snap). Then for the accessories. I am super picky and had spent a decent tine looking for a cover i would like. I gave up as i wasn't able to find anything i liked. Well not Sydnie, she found the perfect case I wanted, with very little information to go on. She found the perfect folio case. My phone an wallet are one in the same. She helped us select two cases for my parents that they love (they were not even in the store at the time). She then quickly applied the tempered glass screen onto my sisters galaxy, without skipping a beat. Sydnie was amazing. We usually rely on a gentleman who works there and has been helping us out for years ( My parents have a loyalty to him as he is married to a South African, because we are from South Africa). He wasn't there today, and not because I don't like him but because I am so happy to have met and been helped by Sydnie. I sincerely hope that AT&T are looking after her well. Thank you so much for all your help. I hope you rise through the ranks quickly. You understand customer service and it shows."],

After an issue I had a 'new' phone sent out to me under warranty last July. That phone overheated so badly It put my four year old into urgent care for burns on her thumb and palm. I was advised to go to a store and they researched my phone for days leaving me with nothing then told me a new phone would be sent to me and not to return the dangerous one. So I left it with them. Then suddenly in November I was charged a restocking fee. I had to pay over $200 of my own money to drive across state(and mountain passes) to go get the phone and send it back. Under the assurance they would take the fee off. Upwards of ten representatives helped me from late nov to now. All politely apologizing for the mistake and dangerous phone and assuring me i would not be charged. Putting the fee balance on hold while it was corrected. Well now you have HAD the phone since DECEMBER 22 and not taken off the fee..and today your supervisor in loyalty Lydia rep#0653226 very rudely told me not only did the previous reps promises and advice not mean anything but that I would not be getting the fee taken off. I am APPALLED by this service. Not only do I feel taken advantage of but stupid to have put my faith in your company to take care of a loyal customer put in danger and harmed by your phone. I trusted your company,most people would have sued for what happened to my child and contacted the media. I however stayed loyal to my longtime company and put the issue in your hands to fix. I feel horrified at how wrong I was and how AWFUL I have been treated. I will be sharing this story with everyone I know and all clients and parents who come inside my store as it is next to your tukwila southcenter location.
